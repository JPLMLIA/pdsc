PDSC: Planetary Data System Coincidences
========================================

The purpose of this package is to allow quick querying via Python of remote
sensing observations made of a particular location on the surface of a
planetary body, or overlapping with another observation from any supported
instrument.  Incidentally, `pdsc` also allows querying based on metadata and
transforming between pixel and world coordinate systems. Currently, only
several instruments from Mars orbiters are supported, but the system is
designed to be extensible to other instruments and bodies.

Please refer to the [documentation](https://jplmlia.github.io/pdsc/) for
instructions on installation, setup, and usage.
